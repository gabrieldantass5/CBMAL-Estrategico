## 🤖 AUTO-RESUMO (PONTOS CHAVE)

1. **Remotion (Vídeo como Código)**: O vídeo introduz "Remotion", uma ferramenta que permite criar vídeos usando React e código.
    * *Insight*: Isso permite automação em escala. Imagine gerar vídeos de "Boletim Diário" ou "Alerta de Incêndio" automaticamente puxando dados de uma planilha/API.
    * *Capacidade*: Criar dashboards animados que reagem a dados reais (ex: número de ocorrências) e geram um vídeo MP4 instantâneo.

2. **Workflow de Edição Autônoma**:
    * O autor usa IA para: Transcrever -> Cortar silêncios -> Melhorar Áudio (Auphonic) -> Adicionar legendas estilizadas -> Renderizar.
    * Tudo isso rodando em um script, sem abrir editor de vídeo.

3. **Extração de Design (Web-to-Video)**:
    * Técnica de dar a URL de um site para a IA e pedir: "Crie um vídeo que siga exatamente o design system deste site (fontes, cores, logos)".
    * Isso garante alinhamento total com a identidade visual sem esforço manual.

## 💡 IDEIAS PARA O ECOSSISTEMA CBMAL

1. **Boletim Operacional em Vídeo (Automático)**:
    * Criar uma skill `video-maker-cbmal` (usando Remotion) que lê os destaques do dia no SEI/Relatório Diário e gera um vídeo de 30s ("Stories") com o brasão e identidade do CBMAL.

2. **Dashboards Animados**:
    * Em vez de apenas Power BI estático, usar a técnica do vídeo para criar painéis animados de "Metas do Trimestre" para exibir nas TVs do Quartel do Comando Geral.

3. **Auphonic para Nossas Transcrições**:
    * O vídeo recomenda o uso do "Auphonic" ou similar para limpar o áudio antes da transcrição. Podemos integrar um passo de "Noise Reduction" (via ffmpeg) no nosso `youtube_transcriber.py` para melhorar a precisão em vídeos com ruído de fundo (comum em operações).

## 📝 CONTEÚDO ÍNTEGRO

A.I. tem uma concentração de contente de qualquer. Antigravete pode agora criar uma animação de bonitos, productes e também editar os vídeos completamente em autopilot. Essa é usando remoção, uma nova skill que só se faça e vai mudar tudo. E em este vídeo, eu vou mostrar como criar algo tão bom que você poderia usar. E não só isso, eu vou mostrar vocês em capacidades hidro, que 99% de views não mesmo se existem. Então você pode editar os vídeos com AI, saving you time e super charging your business. E se você não sabe o que eu, o meu nome é Jack Roberts. Eu dou e saí meu last-text startup com 60.000 customers. E agora eu vou dar um 7-figure AI Automação Business. Então, se você não está já. Grate a café e deixa-te se estragar. E depois de jogar essa forma, a coisa que eu vou fazer na sua vida é que eu vou explorar o seu mind. Por exemplo, esse aqui, esse intrativo dashboard, é criado pela remoção. Ele deu isso em os primeiros guidelines que eu queria, desde meu website específico. E ele deu isso em um prompt, logo da sua casa, e porém, esse é dinamicamente updateado por que existe aqui. Por exemplo, se eu change isso de 8,300, para algo que é 100,000. E eu vou ir para o dashboard. Vou ver isso. Vou mudar o canal para 100,000 instantaneously. Então você tem dinamico updateado. Mas não só isso, eu dei um vídeo para meu notebook LM. E não só me cota, também eu dou essas capturas exactas, especificamente, usando os exactos de blindes de blindes de blindes. Eu dou um vídeo especificamente, na parte da sua audiência, então eu vou falar isso. É isso que eu vou usar para o seu skill, porque... Isso é incrível. Então, eu dou um complete audiência, eu dou um subtalho, eu dou um prompt, eu vou ver tudo em esse vídeo. E você vai ver como você pode poder colocar esses acessos do seu website, como eu posso ver. Poula dos images, pôl do seu webpage, e criar esses vídeos para literalmente o que você quer. Então, vídeo com voz. Vamos falar sobre isso. Precisamente, remoção, que é o ingenho. Isso faz tudo esse popular. Então, o que é remoção? O TLDR é que você pode fazer vídeos programaticamente. O que é isso, actually, mesmo? E por que isso é tão poderoso? Bem, se você pensar como é isso, o que eles têm feito é cada um de vídeos assosados, então, então, se eu te falar, é codo. E a ideia é que quando cada um é codo, podemos usar programas para criar funções, funções, condicionais, para automatizar e escalar vídeo-produção, vídeo-editando, grafitas animais, usando AI. É isso que é tão grande. Você pode, effectively, compor com codo, que é uma super artista de tecnologia. Você pode compor com codo. Você pode exportar em muitos formats, que é muito legal. E para dar uma vista de essa pessoa, você pode ver que eles são absolutamente funcionando agora. E é uma coisa que nós estamos falando sobre o fato de que esses os seus esclaves são available. E podemos conectar os enviores como antigravidade, encursar e usar a indossémino. Eu quero te calcular. O que é o mercado é tão grande. Se você é super-magic, eles fizeram 1 milhão de ARR em três meses. Eles são vídeos editados. Você tem esse filme aqui, AI-Video, um milhão de AR. 5 milhão de AR e a Anilita de Cring-Raveniu, de um AI ad-maker. 6 milhão de AR com crôio. Você tem o pico. Então, o que nós vamos fazer é dar o clod, que é o AI model que nós vamos usar com uma antigravidade clodista essa remoção. E nós vamos fazer isso com uma antigravidade. E então vamos ver absolutamente tudo que você pode fazer com remoção. Então você está com os diferentes e eu vou te mostrar como você pode usar remoção para os seus esclaves, para o seu personal life, sobre três levels de dificuldade. Estar com a 1 milhão, que é um vídeo editado e enhancing. E para fazer isso, eu vou ir para um clodista com uma ação, e vou colocar um link em descrição, então você pode ir para ele gravar. Porque isso vai ser realmente uma forma de mudar. Então, vamos ver a remoção antigravidade. E o que nós vamos fazer? E esses são alguns exemplos dos oses de coisa que você pode fazer. Vamos ver como é esse setup. Então, você tem o final link para ele gravar o vídeo. Então, vamos fazer isso programar. O primeiro que nós vamos fazer é ir para ele gravar e instalar. E tem alguns coisas que nós vamos fazer. O 1 milhão é instalar aqui. Então, se você não não download, você não vai saber que o JS só ir para ele gravar. Então, você pode poder ir para ele gravar. Então, o que nós vamos fazer é ir para ele gravar. E então, vamos ver a sua antigravidade. Mas antes de fazer isso, eu quero que você pode fazer isso. Então, o que é que ele pode generar as suas skilles? Nós temos vídeo, motion e gráfico. Então, intro, animação, explica vídeos, product demos, social media, video ads, animação, infográfico, logar, vilas, conecta-typography. E quando eu fiz esse vídeo, eu queria ser algo que você poderia usar. Eu encontro um loto de exemplos, eles não não sejam bem. like the text is like this big and the rest of the image, it's not, it's not something you'd actually use. I don't think it was any point talking about it. There is some stuff you can build with this that is incredible. So web design and development, landing pages, marketing sites, dashboards, admin panels, loads of really cool things, then a suite of UI and UX assets, component libraries design systems, loading animations, excuse me, I'm breaking up even thinking about this. Navigation patterns, form designs, data visualizations, you get the idea right, automation tools, content, loads of cool stuff. So you can look at this for inspiration and building it. So let's go ahead and install it. So all we're going to do is come down and grab this and head over to our code editor of choice. We're going to be using the wonderful, beautiful, anti-gravity. And so here we are within the wonderful, beautiful, anti-gravity. And I want to show you one additional function with anti-gravity, but how you can run Claude code outside of the chat window within anti-gravity. And what I'm going to do is show you how you can use Claude code within anti-gravity. So we can do it here by just checking to the promotion and saying, hey, occasionally though, sometimes anti-gravity, you may find that the agent spins up and does something a bit random, which is really cool. So I just want to show you another technique that you can use. So I'm left-hand side and this is great to know, by the way, come down to extensions and do me a favor, type in Claude and you'll see Claude will pop up here, which is awesome, right? And you're going to install that. Now, if you have the Claude desktop app, that should connect automatically. Then check this out. If I just double-click in the middle here, you'll see the mystical, wonderful Claude thing pop up. So I can click on this guy, like so, and I can say, hey, Claude, what's up? All right, now we're doing and talking with Claude and you can basically edit automatically the logical things and Claude is talking to us. So if you ever get any friction with the chat panel, bring Claude code up here. Okay, so all you're going to do is basically say, hey, I'd like you to do this. Excuse me, to do this and then throw all the stuff in. Make sure it's all done and they hit enter and then let anti-gravity work its magic to make sure all those different stuff is basically updated and you can use it. And it's very, very cool. So you can see it's valid. And hey, I've got Node.js installed, which is awesome. Now it's checking to get, which is fantastic. Once that's done, we're able to rock and roll and start using this really cool software. And a secondary little hack for you as well. If you click on this Claude thing here to open up Claude code here, one of the things that you can do is if you want to connect Claude to your MCP servers, if you ever have issues here, is if you click on this, you click on MCP servers and by the way, MCP stands for Model Context Protocol. What it just basically is, is how we connect anti-gravity the outside world, how we connect it to your Gmail and NITAN and App here and any tool you want to. What you can do is click on MCP servers, you can click on Manage MCP servers and obviously you can add any that you want to. Right, and when you're in this, you can see, which I just basically bring this guy across a little bit. So you can see, if you click on View Rock Config, you can copy all of that, put it into Claude code and say, hey, quote your own MCP config and that will give Claude the ability to access all of your MCP servers. Just a little hack on one to show with you, just so you're ready to rock and roll at all times. These gems are just, they're going to be flying inside the video. So get ready and hope you're well-caffeinated. Cool. So now it's done. It's basically installed everything and we should be ready to rock and roll. Now, the first thing that I want to do here and the way that I kind of do it is, you can create a new file here on the left and the side called Videos or whatever you want to write. So if I come down here and I create a new folder and let's call this folder something like videos to edit. Okay? Beautiful. So we have videos to edit. What I want you to do is drop an unedited video within that folder. So let's go and grab one from my desktop. So I've got one here, which is 21 seconds long. Let's hear what it sounds like. The next thing that we need to do is actually we're leveraging 100%. No captions, right? So this is no book trim. So what I'm going to do is click an X on this, right? I'm going to grab this. I'm going to bring it over and drop it into videos to edit. Okay? Cool. So now it's within videos to edit and can we hear it? Which is really cool. Okay. Nice. So very, very, very decent. So what I want to do is basically add captions. So how do I do that? One of the things that you can do, if you've got a specific brand or style, we can make that happen. So what we're going to do is head back over to our notion document, which is over here. What I've done with you is listed like three really cool use cases that we can do. So if I scroll down, let's have a quick look. Workflow 1 is automated video caption broadcast, great output. So we give it the input. What it's going to do is analyze and cut. So it's going to transcribe your entire video with whisper word level timestamps. So this is going to know intelligently where to cut the video and where not to cut the video. It's going to pass the transcript. And we've given you all these instructions because I did all that I want to go and take some time to get depended is to make sure I can give you something really fricking sick. It's going to go through any take two moments. So for example, if oftentimes you know, if I make a mistake, does JR make mistakes? Yes, he does sometimes actually 100%. What happens to pass the transcript is he'll say, oh, great, that was obviously mistake and it will cut that out for you. It's going to trim the video. Then it's going to audio process it using something called offonix, which is incredible, by the way. And you can get started with it for free. So it's going to improve your audio output and I'll show you the difference. Then what it's going to do is every motion caption engine and that's going to be the thing that adds in the fonts. The biggest mistake that people make with this stuff, people don't pay enough attention to detail on the fonts and the size of the fonts. The visual hierarchy, the white space, how it flows, all these different details. We've got all the typography. So again, we're going to get some brilliant beautiful Google fonts. We've got different spaces. These are just the ones that I found works best for me. Just having a look at it. And then basically we've got styling logic. So this has been pulled from my website. I'll show you that in a second. Pecshadow, audio, clean up rules. And then we've got the render and the product structure and the execution rules. So what we're going to do is literally copy this like so, one cycle in the common grab. All of this content like that come all the way down. Sweet. So I'm going to do this. I'm going to head back over to anti-gravity, which is here. And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to say, tag the project file. So do shift at. If you type in, I think there's videos to edit, videos to edit right there. It's got one file. And then come down and just paste it in. Really, really cool. And send that off. Fantastic. Now I want to give you another bit of wisdom. So I've already pre-selected here my own specific brand guidelines. But check this out. If I double click on the whole here, I click on the code, which I can open the terminal. I just do this because I prefer the interface. I might say, hey dude, head over to this website. And I want you to extract the brand guidelines in terms of the typography. I want you to go ahead and grab logo for me in anything else. And then create a file on the left-hand side called glido visual identity. OK. Check this out. And I go for htbs.galido.com. Beautiful. I'm just sending that one off. As you can see, this agent is undergoing some kind of improvement right now. Hence why it's like terminated. So what I'm actually going to do is show you right now how you can leverage this Claude code thing within anti-gravity if you ever come into, basically, you ever encounter a time like this. So we're going to dismiss this. We're going to come back over. And we're going to copy all this information like so. And what we're going to do is just pause this guy for a sec. And it's really cool. Plus I put another one. I'm now got two different Claude types. I'm going to hit that end like that. And instead of asking for edits, let's just just edit automatically. OK. And then send it off. And we can have multiple of these different instances running forwards. And this one can be edit automatically. So we have one Claude agent that's going out and grabbing the information. And if you've got a specific brand or style, I recommend that you do that yourself so that you can make sure that it basically reflects your brand identity. And then we've got the second one here. We're just going to go ahead and do it. So look at this. Ask us questions. What is the path to your video file? We are going to say custom path. I'll provide the full path. Do you have an authentic API key set up? I'm going to say, yes, different variable name. So I want you to do this. You can skip if you want to, but I highly recommend it. Like so. And then I'm going to give it the information. So let's go ahead and grab our authentic API key. So to do that, click on brave. I'm going to hit over to orphonic.com. Again, I use a font name that like everything. It's really freaking cool. So there's a free count that I made. You get two hours of processing completely free. I've got the paid version, but I highly recommend it. Use it. So come down and grab our API key. To do that, you can click on the cog. Believe it is an account settings. And then when you scroll down, you'll have an API key. And then you can reset it if you want to get a brand new one. So for example, I could do reset API key. Yes, I'm sure. 100%. And I get a new one. You're just going to copy that. Then head back over to anti-gravity. And once here, we're going to finish giving information to what is the full path toward video. So a full path toward video is right here. So you can right click on that. And you come down and you're going to copy path. And then you come over and then you're going to go for other and just type in the path there. And then it's asking for orphonic key. So then I'm going to come down and give it the orphonic key right this. So just do other and just say this is the API key. And then you're just going to paste in the key that you got for morphonic. And then cloud can start working its magic in the background. Then I come back over to our first cloud environment. And you can see the SVG logo is glad a geometric icon. I can use XYZ. So we start to get some brand identity and brand guidelines, which is cool. But what we can do if we want to get an even more detailed version of it. So we're going to say, yes, that's fine. As you can head over to let's come up here right now. And here you get, again, overview, really cool. Coming to playgrounds at all you ever do is type in galido.com, which is our speech to text starter, just lunched in beta. Very, very fast, I must say. And you can see now, once that's done, we're going to come down and we can see the branding, which is awesome. What this will do is basically attack a website. I say attack. Attack is going to be a powerful word. But it'll go onto website, grab all the information, data for you, and give you everything from it. So here you can see we've got the logo, we've got the primary colors, we've got the fonts. So you can just copy this for any website, come back, and then build videos in those assets. And you can see now, look at this, it's extracted, a video and transcribed it with Whisperer API. It's analyzing the transcripts of the FI clean take. And then it's going to process the audio through off-phonic. So oftentimes online for any content, people will forgive bad visuals, they will never forgive bad audio. So that audio crispness is so, so important. So the fact now that we've got this workflow, we can edit it, we can trim it, we can do anything, and also get beautiful captions at the right moment. It's crazy. And I just want to say as well, you can scale this up to actually infinite complexity. And by that, I mean that we can build these series of editing rules, we can say, hey, first of all, eliminate all pauses. Secondly, if there's a double take, remove the first take, and by trial and error, you can build up an editing system, and you could edit a full video with this, 100%. But even if you didn't want to, you can still save like 80% to 90% on your editing time, that will completely enhance all the audio. So the moment, for example, before this, my editor is grabbing my videos, what he does, he runs it through a phonic, right? Now this could be set up programmatically, but it doesn't physically need to do this. Like that's the level we're going to now. It's really crazy. And at this stage, we can see it's now running the Remosthen Caption Project, which is freaking awesome. And I love this. So the fact that we can edit videos is so crazy. Like you know, imagine like how many more clients, video editors could work with now as a result of this. It's so freaking cool, honestly. And what I like the most is the typography we can do, the colors we can do. And I'm going to show you exactly what that looks like. Honestly, I hope you've buckled in, because it's about to get crazy. Just want to pull you down just to, can you see this? Look, this is when I say it's covered everything. So look, this is pulled down everything. So now we've covered exactly. And it's almost to the millisecond here guys. Everything I've said and where it is. And it's pulling up the specifics. It's cutting things out. It is really freaking impressive. It's like video editing software. Like I started off learning Premiere Pro. Like when I was, actually no first, it was Imovesis, then Premiere Pro. Now we have once again, anti-gravity and these other environmental tools and cloud code just keeps snatching up and moving into every software imaginable. And as you can see right now guys, it's now rendering the final video to the desktop. Now there's a big divide and kind of like coding community about like, should I just use the terminal or this? You can use the terminal, right? You can use that terminal to do things. At my view though, I think visual interface matters for this kind of thing, which is why I prefer to build in these environments. One thing I also want to put attention to as well is that you can do this for multiple videos simultaneously. So for example, if I had five videos, 10 videos, 50 videos, I can create so many different, just keep on pressing this button, that's exactly going through it and each of them will go and work on a completely separate video. Like that's how, when you do that programmatic, like this is why it adds scale. You nail the process, then you can scale this up using these tools. And so like this, it's now completed. whisper transcription, 74 words, with all timestamps. No edits needed. It's already clean, fantastic. But I can assure you it does editing quite well. Leveled, normalized, so it's not often it's processing and it's denoiced. So we can actually listen to the difference and caption engine. I enter, okay, beautiful. So to put it on my desktop, so let's head up to my desktop and check this out. Beautiful. So now it has officially completed it. So let's compare the difference. And as you can see, in videos to edit, I've got both the previous and the new one. So let's check out the difference. And I want you to be close to attention to the audio-deference, you ready? So now we've covered exactly how to leverage notebook LM and combine that with anti-gravity. The next thing that we need to do is make sure we're leveraging 100% of anti-gravity's capabilities by using its skills. Because you see the difference in audio quality guys and the actual transcripts? I mean, this is literally insane. Like that transcription was perfect. Like, can you even look at this? It's outrageous. All the way through, look, is insane. Using its skills, because if we're not using the skills, we're not getting the same. So we're not getting the same. So we're not getting the same. We're not getting the same. But what if I want to edit it? I'll check this out. And I've just asked it to increase the text by 40%. And it will do that for us, edit it, and then put it there. So what we'll have on the left-hand side is a video to edit folder. And underneath can be completed edits. And if it gives you back anything that you don't like, we just say, hey, basically fix it. Now the key final step here before I show you the next level is that whenever it's finished, I want you to give it the following prompt, which is, hey dude, what I'd like you to do is create a system and a standard operating procedure to replicate this. So if I give you future videos that you'll be able to do the exact same style and be extraordinarily specific when I trigger this, please. Awesome. You can even create a skill to do that as well. So it's very thing, I might even say, what I'd like to do is create for me a skill for this that I can activate that will then complete the process. Bam, you basically just say that to it, throw it in, and then it will go ahead and do that for us. And what I'll do, guys, also is I'll just copy this, and I'll add this to the notion document so you can make it applicable also. And just so you know where it is, guys, is right at the bottom of the page. And also, this is not complete. So now it's increased it from 140 pixels to 200. So let's check it out and sort of looks like. With COVID, exactly, it has a leverage in the book, LLM, and combine that with our title guarantee. The next thing that we need... And that's it. And that, guys, you can see just how freaking crazy this is. Now, this is just the beginning, because this now takes us very nicely onto the second level. And so now we can edit anybody we want to enhance the audio with a completely autonomous workflow that could do it for 100 videos without touching a single keyboard. And we build more on these intelligent systems inside the school community, so you can check that out if you like. But the here's the interesting thing we can do now, is that we can give a website to this skill and effectively have it create for us any kind of video graphic animations, which is exactly what we're going to do next. And I'm going to tell you this, which is really interesting, is not only can it work effectively, it can pull down any asset from that page. Okay, we're in Cloud Code. Now I'm going to show this to that, guys. You see the 57% use. The second you hit 50%, I want you to do one thing. And it all is, is literally new window. Bam. Why? Because context rock. After you reach 50%, the first 50% is you and me in the morning. It's 10 a.m. Got our coffees. We're best at life. Second 50% is when it's like 11.50, we're starving, we're tired, we're wanting it to bed, and we're not eating at 10 hours. The point is you, like, refresh the brows and you'll find the performance goes through the roof if you do that. Now check this out. I'm going to give it a prompt like this. Well, actually, hold on a second. Should we write the prompt or should we just swing back over to this document here and just grab it from here, which is the website to design system and animation, remotion, showcase. All we're going to do is give it a website URL. So why don't we do it for Goliatho, HTTPS, data, bam, bam, glado.com. What it's going to do is really interesting. So we are going to analyze and extract the design system. So typography, colors, icons, logo, layouts and components. We're going to create a animated remotion showcase. So in the dimensions that we want, the frames per second we want, the length we specify, changes if you want to. So we're going to do a timeline storyboard, intro, typography, color, pala, blah, blah, blah, blah. Again, this is more just showing what it could do. What I'm going to do is actually remove this because we're not really going to do a storyboard like that. Animation style rules, use spring light motion, keep it minimal, really cool. And then we're going to generate the files and then have the output. So what we're going to do is let's just copy this right here. Let's come down and grab this. And then we're going to head back over to anti-gravity. And then I'm going to say, hey dude, I want you to do for me a 15 second video just describing what the product does. And I want you to sell Maui, not the flights to Maui. I want you to leverage the copy on the page. And I also want you to pull down every single individual asset, like the logos, the logo of the brand. And everything else to Crota as per the below specifications. Cool. Almost ironic here is we're using the tool to get the tool, which is crazy. I'm going to hit execute immediately and then Claude Kou can start to build up for us in the background. Now for me, when I'm looking at tools like remotion, what do I think? You know, in the AI space, there's definitely hype for certain things. And what I want to do in this channel is stay away from it. It's got to be actually functional and workable. Which is why I would example I showed in this video is how you can get production level output, something that you would actually genuinely use. And this stuff is really freaking cool. If you follow these systems, you can do it for anything. And again, if you're struggling on ideas, let's come back up. You're all the stuff you can play around with. This is like being a kid, any proverbial candy store, looking at all this kind of stuff. So the way you should think that are going forward, when you want to do any editing or image. Or asset creation is can this be done programmatically with anti-gravity, with these tools, with remotion using Claude? If it can, it might make sense to build up a workflow. And on that point, we've also got all the to-do's now have been updated. So it's downloading all the assets, the logos, the testimonials. It is going to create the theme, design a showcase, and then when it's done, it's going to rather than video to the desktop. I just told it to put up the desktop because that's where I grabbed my stuff. But if there are, it could be anyway. We could even have a fold on the left-hand side. Whatever you sell the instructions, it will follow that for you. Now, the other cool thing about it being an anti-gravity is that we can use Gemini, right? And the Gemini model has access to Nana Banana. We could also connect this to Nana Banana. So we could generate literally like the best images generated for anything ever, and incorporate that in our videos. Like it has the ability because when you connect anti-gravity in Claude code to anything, that's when it's skills and potentials really go through the roof. And so guys, when it's complete, look at the breakdown here. Scene 1 Hero. The Glider logo. It's got SFG, the Headline's Hypography element too. Speed comparison. Well, lots of interesting details. Let's check it out. Let's open it up real quick, which I have got open for us here. So let's full screen and see what it made for us. All right, it's quick. I've time to fasten every out. Love it. The speed difference is just look at that. That is freaking gorgeous. If you're naturally, you would, instantly, then we've got the logos. And they kind of got this nice soft float to them. Glider, look at this bit of thought. Try Glider for me. Blah, blah, blah. How freaking cool is that? Now let's say that we're a client. So Jack, I don't like green. I like blue. Well, let's just actually come back up to that's gravity and say, how do you love it? Could you just change the green for a blue that would be kind of similar to the green, but the blue version of the green. Bam. Send that one off and we can make edits like this. I could say make me three versions. One blue, one yellow, one green, and I'll decide. And you'll get three completely different versions. All right, guys, so it's done it and it's opened up. Let's see what we've got. Okay, the Glider logo works five times faster. It does indeed. The speed difference is dramatic. We've got blue. It changed it to blue. That's frick it. I mean, I'm not why I'm surprised. This is really freaking cool. But it's just done this because change colors or do anything. But there's anything about this aspect that we don't like. We can change it and we build a system of rules to do that, which is frickin' amazing. So for example, I might say I love the design style with the green one. What I want you to do is create a series of system instructions and a skill on the left-hand side so that in the future when I give you a website, I want you to reproduce the exact same thing that you did for me there. Boom. Now obviously I have given you the prompt, but when we codify that as a skill, you can basically crush it and you'll just do this. Whatever. Now we have a video editing skill for X and a video editing skill for Y. So it's worth you thinking about what are all the asset creations, animations, video editing. But I want to do codify them in skills and anti-gravity, and then let it run rip and do all the for you without touching the single button. And so now you understand exactly how to edit any video, do audio processing, and you also know how to create bespoke animations and graphics that you would actually use and display. The final step that we want to do here, then, is learn how to build animated dashboards or graphics for our websites, for our AI apps, that are actually connected to live data. Now this is going to absolutely blow your mind. So let's start by heading back over to the notion document. And we're going to go down to beautiful use case number three, which is this gorgeous thing here. So website style, interactive dashboard UI, let's go. And what I've basically said of this is do mock data first? Now let's look at the gone. So build an interactive dashboard UI that matches the visual language of in a website you are on. We'll connect super-based later, but for now, design system extraction, UI build and real interactivity are mock data. Deliver a functional responsive UI that looks like the website, feels premium, hover over active states, skeletons, metals charts, is architected for an easy super-based swap later. Super-based is kind of like Microsoft Excel, that's been hitting the gym for a few years. And it's where we're going to store all of our core data. So for example, we could store the number of subscribers we have, or when we're going to get to the stars that we have. And we can now have these interactive beautiful dashboards anywhere on our websites, on our apps, that are connected to super-based to our live data that has been designed and developed and animated by the skill. And the future is here. Now, number one is ExtractBitDesign system from the website, typography, colors, components, spacing, layout. We could use the super-based MCP for this. Next one is to build a dashboard using Extracted Style. Core Components match website exactly, data table charts, models, interactive states, and a mock data architecture that I provide if you down below. Again, all you're doing is copying pasting. So let's come and do this, copy it, and head back over to anti-gravity. And once we're here, looks like we're 96% used. So let's just click on that plus and start afresh. Cool. We're going to come down here, throw this one in here, and we're going to get it the website, which is going to be just your glider. And it's a glider.com. Beautiful. I'm coming down and hit Enter. Now, that's complete. We can check out this beautiful glider dashboard that is built for this cell. Let's give it a look. Can we actually fill screeners? Oh, we can't. Okay, so let's hit Play and see what we've got. Wow. That is really cool. Look at that. That's for a 360. So, what I now want to do is now I've got the component I like. We can decide the things we want, tell users revenue, active, now, blah, blah, blah. Very cool. Let's actually just give it the following prompt. We're going to be interesting. So you'll know from our website design video, vídeos. A chicação Webul Gorgeous Websites me look at this interactive atim. Bessoal, it'll be the video preceding this, or will be the next one. I'll let you see, bit of his next one. You're really going to want to check out how I do this, where you can see. This Gorgeous Website, right? You have other things. We've got this wonderful thing that pops up. Get a free critique on your website, which is our lead magnet, invest in our Y. It's a different growth packages. By the way, these tests from me, those are amazing because they go left to write their gorgeous, and when you scroll down, we've got this beautiful animation, stop bending cash on bad websites. Freakin' awesome. Event at the bottom, you can also come down, and create an account, and just look at this interactive form. I showed you exactly how to build this. But the point is, let's say that on this website, we want to talk about a number of clients we work with, or we can build an interactive dashboard. Look, I've just shown you. Integrate it onto this website, for example. And the second we get a new client, we update that in SuperBase, and it reflects instantaneously. It could be revenue. It could be a number of Instagram followers, YouTube followers, and we have these gorgeous dynamic dashboards now that are animated, that we can sync with data. Do you see how crazy this is? So if I come back over to anti-gravity, when I say, yes, make all the edits, it's super cool. When that's done, we're going to have it on our webpage, and then we're going to connect it to SuperBase. So you can see exactly how you do this for any bulldo doing for your own business, or those of your clients. Beautiful. So now we've got it. I'm having a look at it, and it's going left to right. That's not kind of what I really wanted. What I wanted to do was more rotate, like, three-dimensionally. So let's give it that feedback, and then let's also say that I wanted to be interactive components by what to hover over, it would like kind of change calls and stuff. Let's go back to anti-gravity, and we'll get to the front. Hey, dude, sorry, I didn't mean left to right. I kind of wanted to be very small movements, but almost like it's rotating on an axis, like it's 3D. So it doesn't go left to right. It kind of like, imagine the right side seems a bit closer, than the left side seems a bit closer, but only small distinct movements. After that, I would like to go ahead and embed this onto a HTML website for me. Beautiful. I'm going to send that one off, and let my anti-gravity work its magic. Beautiful. So now it's done it. We've got this thing here. We've got the logo. We've got features in pricing, an example thing. If I scroll down and look at our dashboard guys, you hover over things. I love that neon glum. So these numbers, though, are not really accurate. We want to connect it now to superbase. So what I'm going to do is actually head straight back over to anti-gravity, and then we're going to give it the following prompt in anti-gravity. Hey, dude, I want you to connect to superbase, via the superbase MCP. I want it like you to do is connect that with the numbers on the front end dashboard. If those numbers don't exist, simply create and form me in the superbase MCP. Awesome. And once you've entered in that prompt, it'll then use your superbase MCP to connect. Now, the calling of anti-gravities, steadies to connect it together. And the way you can grab any MCP you want to, is you can head over to any language model. So say, for example, look, I've got this Clucode instance system right, but check this out. I can't very easily open up a new one by clicking this. Go and find what the MCP config is. What would it be? blah, blah, whatever it is. It'll then grab it. And then what we can do is head over to superbase and grab our key, which is awesome. So yeah, configuration is fantastic. And so, for your own, you go to guys, is superbase.com, forward slash dashboard, forward slash account, forward slash tokens. Come down here to generate your token, like so. I will call this one, Jack, Robert, 654. All right, click on generate your token. I'll just put this to expire within an hour. For argument's sake, obviously, as long as you'd like, there's going to generate, and you're going to copy, but then head straight back over to anti-gravity. And then we can say something like, hey, dude, I want you to connect with the superbase MCP using the below token and save this to the Claude MCP file, so that I may use this at any time in the future with all the Claude agents. Awesome. Come down and head down there. Wonderful. And once you've added it in guys, it will now add the superbase MCP for you. So you don't even need to think about the dashboard, touch the dashboard, dream about it, it doesn't. Now, you'll need to reset Claude to do this. And just say to Claude, hey, give me a prompt so that when I restart it, I can pick up the conversation where I left. And all you do is just copy the prompt like that, like so. And then we're going to click off on both of these. And then what we're going to do is shut down anti-gravity. And just quit it. Then when we reload, double click, which is going to be cool like so. And then again, we're going to click on the Claude thing here. And then once we've got Claude open, we just come back and we enter in the prompt, which is cool. And we'll just do the edit automatically for us, please. Bam. And then it should be ready to rock around with them. Once this is done, we'll have your dynamic, beautiful visual, connected to a backend database. And whenever that number changes, your website will update for you automatically. And this works with any component, any style, we could sit down here and tell it to change it to blue to change the numbers, to change the design, the layout, anything you could possibly want. And this is saying to base that up, we're going to go for the super base MCP real quick. That's fine. And submit that. Beautiful. And then once it's connected to the MCP of your super base, it should now be a direct reflection. So we've got the website. You can see our graphics. This is exactly what we built. Very cool. And we love this glow. So if I head over to super base, and you can find the table by my left hand side coming down to table editor. And then you should see the table there. And I've got value. So let's just say that could be, hey, this is how much revenue we've generated for our clients. Or this is how many clients we've got. So 100,000, one of it was 200, and actually 250,000. Awesome. Then if I come back over to the website here, we should see the subdate now to 250,000. Once I refresh the page, I'm going to come down there. Another revenue has become $250,000. Now knowing how to build beautiful graphics is amazing. But it won't ever let you reach a potential, unless you know how to build beautiful user interfaces that aren't video generated. And you can learn that by clicking on this video right here.
